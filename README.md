Description/Directions:
  1.) Download .zip file
  2.) Extract folder into desired directory
  3.) Ensure Flask is installed on your system or virtual environment
  4.) run the command "python app.py" in the command line while in the folders directory
  5.) open a web browser, the application can be accessed via "HTTP://127.0.0.1:5000"

Notes for graders:
  Sorry I don't have the search funtion, I tried for awhile but just couldn't get it to work
  also, yes there are unneeded files within the folder, however for some reason I couldn't get the app to run if I removed them, so no harm in keeping them right?
